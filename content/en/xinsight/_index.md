X Insight is an unofficial, multiplatform and [open-source](https://github.com/victor-marino/xinsight) client for Indexa Capital.

It's been developed in [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), and it uses the [official Indexa Capital API](https://indexacapital.com/en/api-rest-v1) to read your account data securely.

It is available for Android and iOS.

> Note: The iOS version is distributed through AltStore PAL, an alternative app store for Europe. You can install AltStore PAL from its [official website](https://altstore.io/).
