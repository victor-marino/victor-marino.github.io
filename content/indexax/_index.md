Indexa X is an unofficial, multiplatform and [open-source](https://github.com/victor-marino/indexax) client for Indexa Capital.

It's been developed in [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), and it uses the [official Indexa Capital API](https://indexacapital.com/en/api-rest-v1) to read your account data securely.

It is currently available for Android only, as Apple no longer allows the app in their App Store.

The iOS version has been removed from the App Store, as per Apple's request. I hope I can offer the iOS app to European users again in the future through alternative app stores.
