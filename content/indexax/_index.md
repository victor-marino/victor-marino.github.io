Indexa X is an unofficial, multiplatform and [open-source](https://github.com/victor-marino/indexax) client for Indexa Capital.

It's been developed in [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), and it uses the [official Indexa Capital API](https://indexacapital.com/en/api-rest-v1) to read your account data securely.

It is currently available for Android only, as it had to be removed from the App Store at Apple's request.

I hope I can offer the iOS app to European users again in the future through alternative app stores.
